# Reducing R01s with Machine Learning and Transaction Analysis

# Overview

During my tenure at a fintech company that offers short-term loans, I focused on addressing the issue of R01sâ€”failed payment attempts due to insufficient funds. These failures are costly for both the company and the customers, as they incur significant bank fines.

# In this paper, I present a two-pronged approach to tackle this problem through machine learning and data analysis.

**Machine Learning:** Python & sklearn Models
Using Python and sklearn, I developed rule-based models to create policies aimed at reducing R01s by predicting and preventing failed payment attempts. The models were designed to analyze various features and decide whether a payment attempt should be made.

**Analysis:** SQL Query Analysis
I conducted thorough SQL query analyses to identify patterns and correlated events in the data that could explain the occurrence of R01s. One notable finding was a bug in the system handling multi-payments, which significantly reduced the R01 rate once addressed.
